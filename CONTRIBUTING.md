Contributing
============

![image](https://github.com/brunohbrito/JP-Project/blob/master/docs/images/logo.png?raw=true)

We are open to community contributions.

First, Read this: [Being a good open source
citizen](https://hackernoon.com/being-a-good-open-source-citizen-9060d0ab9732).
There are a couple of guidelines you should follow so we can handle this
without too much effort.

How to contribute?
------------------

Looking to contribute something to Jp Ploject? **Here's how you can
help.**

Contributing to Jp Project
--------------------------

Please take a moment to review this document in order to make the
contribution process easy and effective for everyone involved.

Following these guidelines helps to communicate that you respect the
time of the developers managing and developing this open source project.
In return, we will be lovely persons that respect in addressing your
issue or assessing patches and features.

**The easiest way to contribute is to open an issue and start a
discussion.**

### Using the issue tracker

The [issue tracker](https://github.com/brunohbrito/JP-Project/issues) is
the preferred channel for [bug reports](\#bug-reports), [features
requests](\#feature-requests) and [submitting pull
requests](\#pull-requests), but please respect the following
restrictions:

-   Please **do not** use the issue tracker for personal support
    requests.
-   Please **do not** post comments consisting solely of "+1" or
    ":thumbsup:". Use [GitHub's "reactions"
    feature](https://github.com/blog/2119-add-reactions-to-pull-requests-issues-and-comments)
    instead.

### Bug reports

A bug is a \_demonstrable problem\_ that is caused by the code in the
repository. Good bug reports are extremely helpful!

Guidelines for bug reports:

0.  **Validate and lint your code** &mdash; to ensure your problem isn't
    caused by a simple error in your own code.
1.  **Use the GitHub issue search** &mdash; check if the issue has
    already been reported.
2.  **Check if the issue has been fixed** &mdash; try to reproduce it
    using the latest master or development branch in the repository.

A good bug report shouldn't leave others needing to chase you up for
more information. Please try to be as detailed as possible in your
report. What is your environment? What steps will reproduce the issue?
Did you check the logs? All these details will help people to fix any
potential bugs.

Example:

> **Short and descriptive example bug report title**                    
>                                                                       
> A summary of the issue and the OS environment in which it occurs. If  
> suitable, include the steps required to reproduce the bug.            
>                                                                       
> 1.  This is the first step                                            
> 2.  This is the second step                                           
> 3.  Further steps, etc.                                               
>                                                                       
> Any other information you want to share that is relevant to the issue 
> being reported. This might include the lines of code that you have    
> identified as causing the bug, and potential solutions (and your      
> opinions on their merits).                                            


### Feature requests

Feature requests are welcome. Before opening a feature request, please
take a moment to find out whether your idea fits with the scope and aims
of the project. It's up to *you* to make a strong case to convince the
project's developers of the merits of this feature. Please provide as
much detail and context as possible.

### Pull requests

**Issue First** Before even writing the first line of code raise an
issue and get buy in on your proposal from the maintainers. There’s
several reasons for this, people might already be working on the issue,
the issue might not be an issue or by design, but mainly just letting
the community know your working on something, it gets “assigned” to you
and you get implementation detail feedback early. All to reduce chance
of redoing work or getting your contribution rejected.

Good pull requests—patches, improvements, new features—are a fantastic
help. They should remain focused in scope and avoid containing unrelated
commits.

**Please ask first** before embarking on any significant pull request
(e.g. implementing features, refactoring code, porting to a different
language), otherwise you risk spending a lot of time working on
something that the project's developers might not want to merge into the
project.

Adhering to the following process is the best way to get your work
included in the project:

1.  [Fork](https://help.github.com/fork-a-repo/) the project, clone your
    fork, and configure the remotes:

``` {.sourceCode .}
# Clone your fork of the repo into the current directory
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/free-bootstrap-admin-template.git
# Navigate to the newly cloned directory
cd free-bootstrap-admin-template
# Assign the original repo to a remote called "upstream"
git remote add upstream https://github.com/coreui/coreui-free-bootstrap-admin-template.git
```

2.  If you cloned a while ago, get the latest changes from upstream:

``` {.sourceCode .}
git checkout master
git pull upstream master
```

3.  Create a new topic branch (off the main project development branch)
    to contain your feature, change, or fix:

``` {.sourceCode .}
git checkout -b <topic-branch-name>
```

4.  Commit your changes in logical chunks. Please adhere to these [git
    commit message
    guidelines](http://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html)
    or your code is unlikely to be merged into the main project. Use
    Git's [interactive
    rebase](https://help.github.com/articles/interactive-rebase) feature
    to tidy up your commits before making them public.
5.  Locally merge (or rebase) the upstream development branch into your
    topic branch:

``` {.sourceCode .}
git pull [--rebase] upstream master
```

6.  Push your topic branch up to your fork:

``` {.sourceCode .}
git push origin <topic-branch-name>
```

7.  [Open a Pull
    Request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/) with
    a clear title and description against the master branch.

**IMPORTANT**: By submitting a patch, you agree to allow the project
owners to license your work under the terms of the [MIT
License](https://github.com/brunohbrito/JP-Project/blob/master/LICENSE).
